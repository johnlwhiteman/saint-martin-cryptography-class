# Compression and Encryption

This demo compresses and then encrypts a plaintext file. It also encrypts and then compresses against the same plaintext file. Check the output file sizes to see if there are differences and, if there are, why.

## Execution

```bash
# You'll need to have python 3.10 or greater installed.

# Run the program
python ./runDemo.py

# And here are the files
plaintext.txt
compressed-encrypted-plaintext.bin
compressed-plaintext.bin
encrypted-compressed-plaintext.bin
encrypted-plaintext.bin
```
